# 2.1.3 Theorem - Zero Product Property and Multiplicative Inverses
* (a) If $a \neq 0$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$ are such that $ab=1$ then $b=\frac{1}{a}$
    * Uniquness of Mult. Inverses
* (b) If $a*b = 0$ then either $a=0 \lor b=0$

*Proof*:
- Suppose $ab=0$ and $a \neq 0$
- Goal: Show $b=0$

Invoking Multiplicative Identity
$$ 
b = 1*b = b 
$$

Existance of Multiplicative Inverse
$$
1*b = (\frac{1}{a}*{a})b
$$

Communitive Property of Multiplication
$$
(\frac{1}{a}*{a})b = \frac{1}{a}*{ab}
$$

By Supposition:
$$
b = \frac{1}{a}*{ab} = \frac{1}{a}*{a*0} = 0
$$
