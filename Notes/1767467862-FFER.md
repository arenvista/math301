# Completeness Property of R

`Fun fact - R is a complete ordered field`

## Def
Let $S \neq \emptyset, S \subset \mathbb{R}$
* $S$ is said to be *bounded above* if... 
    * there exists a number $u \in \mathbb{R}$ s.t. $x \leq u$ for $x \in S$
    * Each such number $u$ is called an **upper bound** of $S$
* $S$ is said to be *bounded below* if... 
    * There exists a number $w \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $w \leq x, \forall ~x \in S$
* $S$ is said to be *bounded* if it is bounded above or below; else it is *unbounded*

### [Supremum](1767468425-ZENJ.md) 
If $S$ is bounded above, than a number $u$ is said to be a **supremum** (least upper bound) of $S$ if it satisfies:
* $u$ is an upper bound of $S$  $(s \leq u, \forall s \in S)$
* $v$ is any upper bound of $S$ then $u \leq v$
* Supremum of $S: sup S$

### [Infimum](1767468417-JZKR.md)
If $S$ bounded below, then a number $w$ is said to be an **infimum** (greatest lower bound) of $S$ if it satisfies:
* $w$ is a lower bound of $S$ $(s \leq w \forall s \in S)$
* If $t$ is any lower bound of $S$, then $w \leq t$
* Infimum of $S: inf S$
