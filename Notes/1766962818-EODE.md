# 2.1.4 Theorem - Irrationality of √2
$$\text{Statement: }\not \exists ~r \in \mathbb{Q} \ni r^2=2$$

## Proof

Supppose for the sake of contradiction:
* Let $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0$
* $\exists ~r \ni r=\frac{p}{q}$ 
* And $\frac{p}{q}$ are in their lowest terms 
    * $\implies$ $p,q$ how no common divisors greater than one

By supposition:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Suppose } r^2=2
\implies (\frac{p}{q})^2 &= 2 \\
\implies \frac{p^2}{q^2} &= 2 \\
\implies p^2 &= 2q^2 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Observe RHS is even implies LHS is even:
* $2q^2$ is even $\implies p^2=2k, k \in \mathbb{Z} \implies p=2d, d\in \mathbb{Z}$

This clearly demonstrates that $p,q$ are both divisible by two
* ***Note***: $p,q$ were said to be at their lowest possible terms, thus should not be divisible by any factor other than one

$$\implies \not \exists ~p,q \ni r \in {\mathbb{Q}} \implies r \in \mathbb{Q}' \text{ if it exists}$$
