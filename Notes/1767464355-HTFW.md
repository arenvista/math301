# Archimedean Property

Statement: *there are no infinitely large or infinitely small numbers* in the real numbers

## Intuition
Imagine you want to walk from one end of the galaxy to the other, but you can only take baby steps. The distance to travel is massive (y), and your step size is tiny (x).

The Archimedean property guarantees that if you take enough steps (n), you will eventually surpass the distance. No matter how huge the distance or how tiny the step, you never get "stuck" being infinitely far away.

If a number system were non-Archimedean, it would contain "infinite" distances that you could never reach, no matter how many finite steps you took.

## Formal Statement

### Comparing Two Numbers
There are two common ways to state this property formally in the context of Real Numbers (R).

For any two positive real number $x$ and $y$ (where $x,y > 0$), there exists a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that:

$$ nx > y $$

*Intuition*:
You can multiply the smaller number $x$ by a large enough integer $n$ to make it bigger than the larger number $y$

### Unboundedness of Natural Numbers
For any real number $y$, there exists a natural number $n$ such that:
$$n > y$$
*Intuition*:
The set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,...\}$ never stops or hits a "ceiling". It is not bounded above.
